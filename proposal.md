Here is a suggested outline for your proposal. You don't need to follow this
outline, but it may help you focus your project.

* Project title
* Team members
* Description (1 pp describing the basic idea)
* Hardware required (itemize what hardware, if any, you need)
* Funds requested (the amount you will want to be reimbursed, remember you have
  a $20 budget per person)
* Major task breakdown and who is responsible for each task
* Goals for next week
* References and resources used

Keep the proposal short and to the point.

We suggest you try to get all the major hardware components working by the
first week. That will leave the following week for putting the components
together into a working system.
